Information on this page is written with the assumption that you understand the new priority list, talents, and legendary items introduced in Shadowlands. If you have not done so, we highly recommend reading our other resources to learn about them!

This guide is intended to help you identify critical mobs and abilities as well as improve your mechanical literacy in using your toolkit as an Elemental Shaman in each dungeon. If you have any feedback about this guide, please feel welcome to reach out to the team!

# Talents and Legendaries

For novice Elemental Shaman, we recommend the following:

* **15:** {{site.data.talent.echo_of_the_elements}}
* **25:** {{site.data.talent.aftershock}}
* **30:** {{ site.data.talent.spirit_wolf }} or {{ site.data.talent.static_charge }}
* **35:** {{ site.data.talent.master_of_the_elements }}
* **40:** {{ site.data.talent.natures_guardian }}
* **45:** {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}
* **50:** {{ site.data.talent.stormkeeper }}
* **Legendary:** {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }}

This setup is great for players starting out as well as for +15 keys and beyond. {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} is the most beneficial legendary power for AoE while also offering strong single target damage.

In coordinated and varied group compositions, you may consider {{ site.data.talent.elemental_blast }}, {{ site.data.talent.storm_elemental }}, and/or {{ site.data.talent.ancestral_guidance }} as potential talents, as well as {{ site.data.legendary.windspeaker }} or {{ site.data.legendary.skybreaker }} as potential legendary powers. Think critically about what your group needs to decide if you want to explore those options or not. For more reading, please visit our [Talents](http://stormearthandlava.com/guide/general/talents.html) and [Legendaries](http://stormearthandlava.com/guide/general/legendaries.html) pages.

# Miscellaneous Tips

* Although strategies are listed for mobs and bosses, communicating with your group how each pull should be executed is more important. Some suggestions may not be applicable depending on your group's strategy.
* {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} is a potent ability best used to soak damage away from the tank or as an emergency button to avoid a party wipe. Communicate with your tank on using {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} for challenging trash packs as well as remind your healer to keep the {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} healthy as needed. Remember that with {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}, you can manually move the pet, and you have access to an additional defensive with {{ site.data.spell.harden_skin}} and single-target stun with {{ site.data.spell.pulverize }}. However, keep in mind that you cannot have {{ site.data.spell.earth_elemental }} and {{ site.data.spell.fire_elemental }} summoned at the same time with {{ site.data.talent.primal_elementalist }}.
* Often times, your tank may need to kite. Remember the kiting tools at your disposal ({{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.frost_shock }}, {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }}) to distance trash packs away from your tank.
* Routinely support your healer and your group with healing abilities and {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}. Note that the healers that cannot remove Curses are: Discipline Priest, Holy Priest, Holy Paladin, and Mistweaver Monk.
* Plan with your group in advance on where to use {{ site.data.spell.heroism }} / {{ site.data.spell.bloodlust }}.
* [Learn to log your dungeon runs!](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/help/start) Warcraft Logs filters dungeons with pull-by-pull analyses and records replays of dungeon run. Having logs available to share are helpful for you to receive actionable feedback.

# Affixes

**Level 4:**

* Bolstering: Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can. Swap to priority damage rotation for any lethal mobs or if mob health within trash packs are uneven.
* Bursting: Support your party members and use your healing abilities to mitigate the Bursting debuff. Use Astral Shift as needed if stacks are high.
* Inspiring: Crowd control mobs with Inspiring Presence with Hex as needed and when possible.
* Raging: Be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your tank when needed. Consider using Capacitor Totem and Stormkeeper to finish Raging mobs more safely and quickly.
* Sanguine: Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can to lessen time spent in Sanguine, but be sure to not slow or stun mobs dying unevenly. Use Thunderstorm as needed to knock mobs out of Sanguine.
* Spiteful: As mobs are dying, be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your melee players. Consider taking advantage of Spiteful mobs as additional Chain Lightning or Flame Shock targets.

**Level 7:**

* Explosive: Explosive orbs can be destroyed in a single Frost Shock global. This will be your most efficient tool to deal with them as your other abilities are more valuable for trash.
* Grievous: Remember that direct heals remove one stack of Grievous Wound. Support your party members with Healing Surge and Chain Heal as needed.
* Necrotic: Be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your tank when needed. Earth Elemental is also helpful to help your tank control Necrotic stacks.
* Quaking: Maintain your distance from party members, and be mindful about canceling casts if Quaking overlaps with Spiritwalker's Grace.
* Storming: Maintain your distance from mobs to avoid Storming. Use Spiritwalker's Grace as needed in tight spaces or when maneuvering any mechanics.
* Volcanic: Watch your feet. Use Spiritwalker's Grace as needed to maintain your damage uptime while avoiding Volcanic plumes.

**Seasonal Affix:**

* Prideful: It is best to have Prideful before bosses or challenging trash packs, but keep in mind that Bursting With Pride will make up a large source of your damage taken. Plan your damage and defensive cooldowns accordingly, either for the Manifestation of Pride itself or for the pull afterwards, and use healing abilities as needed when fighting the Manifestation of Pride.

* Jagged Quarrel is dangerous when Fortified, and these are the most lethal mobs in the packs they're in. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed if targeted by Jagged Quarrel.

## Xav the Unfallen

* Xav always does Seismic Leap prior to Might of Maldraxxus, which will be the highest source of damage taken. Use {{ site.data.spell.astral_shift }} as needed.
* As you may not be pulled down for Blood and Glory, consider refreshing {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }} early to ensure the boss has {{ site.data.spell.flame_shock }} uptime before an Oppressive Banner spawns.
* Use {{ site.data.spell.spiritwalkers_grace }} as needed when dodging the mechanics from Might of Maldraxxus (Crushing Slam, Massive Cleave, Deafening Crash). Don't be caught casting when Xav is casting Deafening Crash; the interrupt effect still applies even when you are out of the circle.
