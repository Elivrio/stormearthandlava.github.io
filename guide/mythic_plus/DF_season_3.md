# Miscellaneous Tips

* Although strategies are listed for mobs and bosses, communicating with your group how each pull should be executed is more important. Some suggestions may not be applicable depending on your group's strategy. For example, plan with your group in advance on where to use {{ site.data.spell.bl }}.

* **Stop cast**, or **Hard CC**, refers to cancelling enemy casts using hard Crowd Control abilities. While some casts cannot be interrupted, they can be cancelled by other means. Regularly be mindful of lethal trash abilities. Also know what you can do to stop a cast and look for alternative ways to interrupt casts if no interrupts are available. Elemental Shaman may stop casts with {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.hex }}, {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} (or {{ site.data.spell.thundershock }}), {{ site.data.spell.lightning_lasso }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }}'s knockdowns.

* **Line of Sight**, or **LoS**, refers to hiding behind a wall or structure to prevent an enemy's ability from targeting or damaging you. Like player casting, mobs must see their target for their spell to cast. Positioning behind a wall or structure breaks their line of sight and stops an enemy from casting; in other words, if you are not within line of sight of a mob, the mob is not within line of sight of you. There are many strategic uses for line of sighting mechanics, such as {{ site.data.dungeon.cos.fel_detonation }} from {{ site.data.dungeon.cos.felbound_enforcer }} in {{ site.data.dungeon.cos.cos }}. As you practice new dungeons, be mindful of your environmental surroundings and identify opportunities to utilize nearby structures to line of sight mobs.

* Routinely support your healer and your group with healing abilities such as {{ site.data.spell.ag }}, {{ site.data.spell.healing_stream_totem }} or even {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}.

* Often times, your tank may need to kite. Remember the kiting tools at your disposal ({{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.frs }}, {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, etc.) to distance trash packs away from your tank.

* Use your CDs. {{ site.data.spell.fe }}, {{ site.data.spell.se }}, {{ site.data.spell.sk }}, {{ site.data.spell.lmt }} or even {{ site.data.spell.ee }}, {{ site.data.spell.swg }} and {{ site.data.spell.ag }} are useless if you never press them cause you are waiting for "the right moment". Planning CDs is even better but learn to press them first and foremost.

* Try to setup pulls in advance. In Wildfire builds, try to keep maelstrom at the end of a pack to get {{ site.data.spell.eq }}, {{ site.data.spell.sop }} and {{ site.data.spell.fs }} spreading at the start of the next pull. In Lightning builds, try to get an {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} buff ready when the pull is being setup by the tank. Try to cast {{ site.data.spell.sk }} before pulls to keep uptime during it, etc.

* {{ site.data.spell.ee }} is a potent ability best used to soak damage away from the tank or as an emergency button to avoid a party wipe. Communicate with your tank on using {{ site.data.spell.ee }} for challenging trash packs as well as remind your healer to keep the {{ site.data.spell.ee }} healthy as needed. Remember that with {{ site.data.spell.primal_elementalist }}, you can manually move the pet and single-target stun with {{ site.data.spell.pulverize }}. However, keep in mind that you cannot have {{ site.data.spell.ee }} and {{ site.data.spell.fe }} summoned at the same time with {{ site.data.spell.primal_elementalist }}.

* Die and retry. You need to experience a lot of death and bad keys to know when a key is good.

- Doing m+ with Pick Up Groups (PUGs) can be tough. Most of the time, they expect you to already have the experience of all dungeons. Take your time to improve, try to find people you enjoy playing with and re-invite them, the only way to get better is to play.

* Scaling isn't linear. That means that going from 15s to 16s is way easier than going from 19s to 20s. You are not bad, the game is making it more difficult.

* [Learn to log your dungeon runs!](https://www.warcraftlogs.com/help/start) Warcraft Logs filters dungeons with pull-by-pull analyses and records replays of dungeon runs. Having logs available to share is helpful for you to receive actionable feedback.

# Affixes

### Level 2:

* {{ site.data.affixes.fortified }}: Consider using {{ site.data.spell.bl }} on hard mob pulls. Some random add abilities that are usually harmless can quickly become deadly and require more interrupts or extra defensives. Coordinate with your party to layer your AoE CC abilities and use {{ site.data.spell.as }} wisely.
* {{ site.data.affixes.tyrannical }}: Boss fights turn into a battle of endurance. Coordinate with your healer to use {{ site.data.spell.ag }} at the best time depending on their need. Many Single target abilities become lethal and require a good {{ site.data.spell.as }} timing to survive.

*Note: Unlike many of the previous extensions, the balance between these two affixes is quite good. As normal mobs are generally easier to navigate than bosses, keys during {{ site.data.affixes.fortified }} weeks will usually be easier to finish but also harder to do in time, since 60% to 70% of the timer in a key is spent doing mobs. On the contrary, hard bosses during a {{ site.data.affixes.tyrannical }} week can be huge walls that will stop you from finishing the key. But the timer will often be more lenient.*

### Level 7 - Periodic affixes:

* {{ site.data.affixes.volcanic }}: Watch your feet. Use {{ site.data.spell.swg }} as needed to maintain your damage uptime while avoiding {{ site.data.affixes.volcanic_plume }}.
* {{ site.data.affixes.storming }}: Maintain your distance from mobs to avoid {{ site.data.affixes.storming }}. Use {{ site.data.spell.swg }} as needed in tight spaces or when handling any mechanics.
* {{ site.data.affixes.entangling }}: Use {{ site.data.spell.gust_of_wind }} to break {{ site.data.affixes.entangled }}'s wines or {{ site.data.spell.thunderous_paws }} and {{ site.data.spell.spirit_walk }} to instantly remove it.
* {{ site.data.affixes.afflicted }}: Always be wary of any {{ site.data.affixes.afflicted_soul }} that spawn. Use {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }} to handle low mob spawn. {{ site.data.spell.poison_cleansing_totem }} will solo the affixe for a few second and should be used in high pressure moments.
* {{ site.data.affixes.incorporeal }}: Since {{ site.data.affixes.incorporeal_being }} are immune to damage, {{ site.data.spell.hex }} is by far the best way to CC them. If multiple spawn, use {{ site.data.spell.wind_shear }} as needed. Be careful, AoE CC abilities do not affect them (so {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} or {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} do not work).

### Level 14 - "On death" and "On health ranges" affixes:

* {{ site.data.affixes.bolstering }}: Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can. Swap to priority damage rotation for any lethal mobs or if mob health within trash packs are uneven.
* {{ site.data.affixes.bursting }}: Support your party members and use your healing abilities to mitigate the {{ site.data.affixes.burst }} debuff. Use {{ site.data.spell.as }} as needed if stacks are high.
* {{ site.data.affixes.raging }}: Consider using {{ site.data.spell.sk }} and other damage CDs later in packs to burst {{ site.data.affixes.enrage }} mobs more quickly.
* {{ site.data.affixes.sanguine }}: Damage trash packs down as evenly as you can to lessen time spent in Sanguine, but be sure to not slow or stun mobs dying unevenly. Use {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} as needed to knock mobs out of {{ site.data.affixes.sanguine_ichor }}.
* {{ site.data.affixes.spiteful }}: As mobs are dying, be ready to use your kiting toolkit to support your melee players. Consider taking advantage of {{ site.data.affixes.spiteful_shade }} as additional {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.fs }} targets.
