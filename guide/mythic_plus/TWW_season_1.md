Information on this page is written with the assumption that you understand the new priority list and talents in The War Within Season 1. If you have not done so, we highly recommend reading our other resources to learn about them!

This guide is intended to help you identify critical mobs and abilities as well as improve your mechanical literacy in using your toolkit as an Elemental Shaman in each dungeon. If you have suggestions to improve the information in this guide please contact elivrio using the [Earthshrine Elemental channel](https://discord.gg/pGkPDzh7rP) or the [Storm, Earth & Lava discord](https://discord.gg/y5dUf3PWrU).

# Talents

There are two main build that will be used in The War Within Season one : Wildfire and Lightning. You can find variation on each of them in the [build page]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link guide/general/builds.md %}).

This page will only note the important utility options that are available to you as an Elemental Shaman. Those remain suggestions and depending on your group, you might not need some of the talent suggested in this guide.

You can also check the [Class Tree page]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link guide/general/class_tree.md %}) to have an idea of the choices available to you in Mythic+.

# Affixes

The Affix System was entirely reworked and most of the previous affixes are now gone from the pool, leaving only {{ site.data.affixes.fort }} and {{ site.data.affixes.tyr }}.

### Level 4 and 10: Tyrannical and Fortified
{{ site.data.affixes.fort }} and {{ site.data.affixes.tyr }} will still be rotating every week for keys between the level 4 and 10. Starting at level 10, both will be active and the week to week rotation will disappear.

Apart from that, the way to deal with these affixes didn't change much:
* {{ site.data.affixes.fortified }}: Consider using {{ site.data.spell.bl }} on hard mob pulls. Some random add abilities that are usually harmless can quickly become deadly and require more interrupts or extra defensives. Coordinate with your party to layer your AoE CC abilities and use {{ site.data.spell.as }} wisely.
* {{ site.data.affixes.tyrannical }}: Boss fights turn into a battle of endurance. Coordinate with your healer to use {{ site.data.spell.ag }} at the best time depending on their need. Many Single target abilities become lethal and require a good {{ site.data.spell.as }} timing to survive.

### Level 7: Challenger's Peril
{{ site.data.affixes.challengers_peril }} is a new passive affix that will increase the normal death timer from 5 seconds to 15 seconds. There's nothing much that can be done about it than not to die. Learning how to use defensive effectively might be a good place to start.

### Level 2: Xal'atath's Bargain
These are the new "seasonal" affixes. They will be replaced at level 12 and establish kiss-curse mechanics

- {{ site.data.affixes.ascendant }}: Use {{ site.data.spell.purge }}, {{ site.data.spell.wind_shear }}, {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }} or {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} to disrupt the {{ site.data.affixes.cosic_ascension }} cast by the orbs. You should be able to spam purge on them. Need to test if you can macro target them.
- {{ site.data.affixes.voidbound }}:
- {{ site.data.affixes.oblivion }}:

### Level 12: Xal'atath's Guile

# Miscellaneous Tips

Although strategies are listed for mobs and bosses, communicating with your group how each pull should be executed is more important. Some suggestions may not be applicable depending on your group's strategy. For example, plan with your group in advance on where to use {{ site.data.spell.bl }}.

**Stop cast**, or **Hard CC**, refers to cancelling enemy casts using hard Crowd Control abilities. While some casts cannot be interrupted, they can be cancelled by other means. Regularly be mindful of lethal trash abilities. Also know what you can do to stop a cast and look for alternative ways to interrupt casts if no interrupts are available. Elemental Shaman may stop casts with {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.hex }}, {{ site.data.spell.thunderstorm }} (or {{ site.data.spell.thundershock }}), {{ site.data.spell.lightning_lasso }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }}'s knockdowns.

**Line of Sight**, or **LoS**, refers to hiding behind a wall or structure to prevent an enemy's ability from targeting or damaging you. Like player casting, mobs must see their target for their spell to cast. Positioning behind a wall or structure breaks their line of sight and stops an enemy from casting; in other words, if you are not within line of sight of a mob, the mob is not within line of sight of you. There are many strategic uses for line of sighting mechanics, such as ({{ site.data.dungeon.cos.fel_detonation }} from {{ site.data.dungeon.cos.felbound_enforcer }} in {{ site.data.dungeon.cos.cos }}). As you practice new dungeons, be mindful of your environmental surroundings and identify opportunities to utilize nearby structures to line of sight mobs.

Routinely support your healer and your group with healing abilities such as {{ site.data.spell.ag }}, {{ site.data.spell.healing_stream_totem }} or even {{ site.data.spell.cleanse_spirit }}.

Often times, your tank may need to kite. Remember the kiting tools at your disposal ({{ site.data.spell.earthbind_totem }}, {{ site.data.spell.frs }}, {{ site.data.spell.capacitor_totem }}, etc.) to distance trash packs away from your tank.

Use your CDs. {{ site.data.spell.fe }}, {{ site.data.spell.se }}, {{ site.data.spell.sk }}, {{ site.data.spell.lmt }} or even {{ site.data.spell.ee }}, {{ site.data.spell.swg }} and {{ site.data.spell.ag }} are useless if you never press them cause you are waiting for "the right moment". Planning CDs is even better but learn to press them first and foremost.

Try to setup pulls in advance. In Wildfire builds, try to keep maelstrom at the end of a pack to get {{ site.data.spell.eq }}, {{ site.data.spell.sop }} and {{ site.data.spell.fs }} spreading at the start of the next pull. In Lightning builds, try to get an {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} buff ready when the pull is being setup by the tank. Try to cast {{ site.data.spell.sk }} before pulls to keep uptime during it, etc.

{{ site.data.spell.ee }} is a potent ability best used to soak damage away from the tank or as an emergency button to avoid a party wipe. Communicate with your tank on using {{ site.data.spell.ee }} for challenging trash packs as well as remind your healer to keep the {{ site.data.spell.ee }} healthy as needed. Remember that with {{ site.data.spell.primal_elementalist }}, you can manually move the pet and single-target stun with {{ site.data.spell.pulverize }}. However, keep in mind that you cannot have {{ site.data.spell.ee }} and {{ site.data.spell.fe }} summoned at the same time with {{ site.data.spell.primal_elementalist }}.

Die and retry. You need to experience a lot of death and bad keys to know when a key is good.

Doing m+ with Pick Up Groups (PUGs) is a pain cause they expect you to already have the experience. Take your time, mute people if you have to, the only way to get better is to play.  

Scaling isn't linear. That means that going from 15s to 16s is way easier than going from 19s to 20s. You are not bad, the game is making it more difficult.
