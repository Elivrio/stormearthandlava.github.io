This page has the answers to some frequently asked questions for Elemental Shamans.

#### Q: "Will Elemental be viable in the coming patch?"
- Viability depends on a lot of factors, inter alia:
  1. Your goals are first and foremost. You do not **need** do be a dwarf to do weekly keys, but you might find it easier to push high keys as dwarf. You don't **need** to be engineer and alchemist to do hard content PvE content, but you'll use more flask and be more frustrated not to have a Battle Res. And so on and so forth.
  1. The content you do. Raid, M+ and PvP are all different enough to have different answers on "what is viable". Notably, High M+ is rather restrictive pretty quickly as it demands a lot of defensives to do high keys. Nonetheless, people have been pushing on almost all class and spec since the beginning of M+ in Legion. Everything is playable, but you might need more efforts to make it work. 
  1. Pretty much nothing matters but your skill and gameplay up until the very hardest content. If you can't clear Heroic raid with as X class, it's not the class fault. It might be the team's fault, or your fault as a player, but the problem will not be the class and spec. This is also true for Mythic raid, Key pushing and Gladiator rank by the way, but the line is muddied by guild/group comp and utility/defensives viability, which brings me to my last point.
  1. **The biggest hurdle to overcome is Community Perception**. People trend to follow the lead of the highest players (Echo/Liquid raid composition, Rank 1 key pusher group comp, etc.). And you might be disregarded for not playing the "correct" class/spec/race/whatever else. There's nothing much that can be done there but to prove them wrong. Which can be difficult if they don't give you the chance to prove yourself.

Tldr: If you play enough and are good enough, anything is viable for 99.99% of the player base.

#### Q: "What do all these abbreviations mean? I can't understand other Elemental Shaman!"

<hr>
#### Q: "What does {{ site.data.spell.fol }} actually reduce?"

<hr>
#### Q: "Do you have any recommendation on how to sim and profiles to use while simming?"

* See the [Consumables]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/consumables.md %}) section of the guide.

<hr>
#### Q: "Does {{ site.data.spell.eq }} stack?"
* Yes, {{ site.data.spell.eq }} stacks and has no stack limit. Also Haste doesn't affect its tick rate.

<hr>
#### Q: "What is funnelling?"
* Funnel means you are utilizing multiple targets to put more damage into a priority target or a boss. In Elemental Shaman's case, it can either refer to:
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on multiple targets in order to generate {{ site.data.spell.lvs }} procs or {{ site.data.spell.magma_chamber }} Stacks.
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.cl }} to generate more Maelstrom in cleave situation then use this maelstrom with {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and {{ site.data.spell.sop }} {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.

<hr>
#### Q: "Is there a point where I don't cast {{ site.data.spell.es }} with {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} talented?"
* **No**, unless you have {{ site.data.spell.eb }} talented, you always alternate {{ site.data.spell.es }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }}.

<hr>
#### Q: "Okay, so what about {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and/or {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then?!"
* **Yes**, these talent choices do impact your spender use:
   - If you have taken {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and *not* {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then you will use {{ site.data.spell.eb }} at 3 and less targets, {{ site.data.spell.eq }} at 4 targets and more.
   - If you have taken {{ site.data.spell.eb }} *and* {{ site.data.spell.eogs }} then you will use {{ site.data.spell.eb }} at 1 target, then alternate {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and {{ site.data.spell.eq }} at 2 targets and more.

<hr>
#### Q: "How many targets should I cast {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on?"
* See the Priority List for each build in the [Build]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/builds.md %}) section of the guide.

<hr>
#### Q: "When do I cast {{ site.data.spell.cl }}?"
* {{ site.data.spell.cl }} replaces {{ site.data.spell.lb }} as a filler from 2 or more targets.

<hr>
#### Q: "What about with {{ site.data.spell.sk }}?"
* With {{ site.data.spell.sop }} talented:
  - 1-2 targets = {{ site.data.spell.lb }} with {{ site.data.spell.sop }} buff active.
  - 3-5 targets = {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.
  - 6+ targets = {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.sop }} buff active.
* Without {{ site.data.spell.sop }}:
  - 1 target = {{ site.data.spell.lb }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.
  - 2+ targets {{ site.data.spell.cl }} or {{ site.data.spell.lvbm }} with {{ site.data.spell.mote }} buff active.

<hr>
#### Q: "When is the best time to use Primal Fire Elemental's {{ site.data.spell.meteor }} and Primal Storm Elemental's {{ site.data.spell.tempest }}?"
* When they would hit the most targets. For {{ site.data.spell.tempest }} specifically, you need to ensure it is also fully buffed by {{ site.data.spell.call_lightning }}.  
*Note: This only applies when talented into {{ site.data.spell.pe }}. Both abilities can be macro'd. See useful macros further down.*

<hr>
#### Q: "Do I use {{ site.data.spell.lvb }} during {{ site.data.spell.se }}?"
* {{ site.data.spell.se }} does not alter the rotation for the builds that use it. During its duration, you will typically behave the same regardless of it being active.

<hr>
#### Q: "What trinkets should I aim for as an Elemental Shaman?"
* For a complete guide about Elemental's trinket, see [Trinket]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link guide/general/trinkets.md %}) section of the guide.
