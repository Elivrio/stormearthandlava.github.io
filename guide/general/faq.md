This page has the answers to some frequently asked questions for Elemental Shamans.

#### Will Elemental be viable in the coming patch?
Viability depends on a lot of factors, inter alia:
1. Your goals are first and foremost. You do not **need** do be a dwarf to do weekly keys, but you might find it easier to push high keys as dwarf. You don't **need** to be engineer and alchemist to do hard content PvE content, but you'll use more flask and be more frustrated not to have a Battle Res. And so on and so forth.
1. The content you do. Raid, M+ and PvP are all different enough to have different answers on "what is viable". Notably, High M+ is rather restrictive pretty quickly as it demands a lot of defensives to do high keys. Nonetheless, people have been pushing on almost all class and spec since the beginning of M+ in Legion. Everything is playable, but you might need more efforts to make it work. 
1. Pretty much nothing matters but your skill and gameplay up until the very hardest content. If you can't clear Heroic raid with as X class, it's not the class fault. It might be the team's fault, or your fault as a player, but the problem will not be the class and spec. This is also true for Mythic raid, Key pushing and Gladiator rank by the way, but the line is muddied by guild/group comp and utility/defensives viability, which brings me to my last point.
1. **The biggest hurdle to overcome is Community Perception**. People trend to follow the lead of the highest players (Echo/Liquid raid composition, Rank 1 key pusher group comp, etc.). And you might be disregarded for not playing the "correct" class/spec/race/whatever else. There's nothing much that can be done there but to prove them wrong. Which can be difficult if they don't give you the chance to prove yourself.

Tldr: If you play enough and are good enough, anything is viable for 99.99% of the player base.

#### What do all these abbreviations mean? I can't understand other Elemental Shaman!
It can be tough trying to learn all of them at once but there is a handy resource to help you! See [Elemental Abbreviations]({{ site.baseurl }}{% link blog/_posts/2023-01-23-ele101.md %}).

#### What does Flash of Lightning actually reduce?
For a complete list, see the [Flash of Lightning]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link blog/_posts/2023-01-23-fol.md %}) post.

#### Do you have any recommendation on how to sim and profiles to use while simming?
For a complete guide about Elemental's sim, see [this post]({{ site.baseurl }}{%link blog/_posts/2023-01-02-simming.md %}).

<hr>
#### Does Earthquake stack?
Yes, you can stack {{ site.data.spell.eq }} without limit. Also Haste doesn't affect its tick rate.

<hr>
#### What is funnelling?
Funnel means you are utilizing multiple targets to put more damage into a priority target or a boss. In Elemental Shaman's case, it can either refer to:
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.fs }} on multiple targets in order to generate {{ site.data.spell.lvs }} procs or {{ site.data.spell.magma_chamber }} stacks.
- Casting {{ site.data.spell.cl }} to generate more Maelstrom in cleave situation then use this maelstrom with {{ site.data.spell.eb }} and {{ site.data.spell.sop }} {{ site.data.spell.lb }}.

<hr>
#### My Primal Elemental is no longer attacking. What's going on?
Check your auto-cast settings for your Elementals (pet action bar). All {{ site.data.spell.pe }} pets share settings, so this can cause issues. 
If this does not work, try to talent out of {{ site.data.spell.pe }} and then talent back. This should resolve the issue.

<hr>
#### When is the best time to use Primal Fire Elemental's Meteor and Primal Storm Elemental's Tempest?
When they would hit the most targets. For {{ site.data.spell.tempest }} specifically, you need to ensure it is also fully buffed by {{ site.data.spell.call_lightning }}.  
*Note: This only applies when talented into {{ site.data.spell.pe }}.*

<hr>
#### Do I use Lava Burst during Storm Elemental?
{{ site.data.spell.se }} does not alter the rotation for the builds that use it. During its duration, you will typically behave the same regardless of it being active.

<hr>
#### Can I use a 2h Weapon as an Elemental Shaman?
Quick tldr before diving into an answer:
- In PvP, you should almost always use a Shield.
- In PvE, you shouldn't focus on it and use what sims the best.
- The same logic applies to 1h + Off-hand.

Let's explain this answer. Defensively, the benefits of a shield are very limited. It grants armor which only mitigates physical damage events, except bleeds. In PvP, you should expect to get auto-attacked a lot, making shield important.

In raid, except outliers such as Sludgefist in Castle Nathria, Physical damage event do not appear frequently enough to justify always using a shield. In Amirdrassil, the only notable physical damage event in the whole raid was Urctos' charge on Council of Dreams.

In Mythic+, you may anticipate more instances of physical damage (e.g trash fixates, ranged random auto attacks, aggro issues, ...). However, these are not common or important enough either to justify a shield before going into higher level of keys.

That's why most PvE players should consider the offensive benefits first and foremost. Even with the newly added {{ site.data.spell.thunderstrike_ward }}, if sims tell you to use a 2h weapon, you should use it (and talent out of {{ site.data.spell.thunderstrike_ward }}).

#### Why can't I see Overload Damage in Details?
It's a setting. Go to `Details Options Panel` > `Options` > `Rename Spells` > Uncheck `Merge Spells with the Same Name`.

#### Any tips to become a better player? 
The following post is from 2014 and still dead on more than 10 years later. It's not about the gameplay, it's about the mentality. While it was initially written for raid and mythic+ didn't exist back then, most of the topics of the post apply for mythic+.
