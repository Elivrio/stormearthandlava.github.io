## Legendaries

TLDR:
Windspeaker for single target
Skybreakers for spread cleave
EoGS for M+ and stacked AoE


The following charts show the value of specific Legendaries in single target and AoE situations. Use this as a general guide, but don't treat it as gospel. Remember that different legendaries are propped up by different sets of stats and the charts are simmed with a constant set of gear.
