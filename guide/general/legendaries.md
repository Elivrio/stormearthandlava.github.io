## TL;DR Recommendations
- {{ site.data.legendary.windspeaker }} for single target
- {{ site.data.legendary.eogs }} for M+ and stacked AoE
- {{ site.data.legendary.night_fae }} for M+ and stacked AoE
- {{ site.data.legendary.skybreaker }} for spread cleave

The following charts show the value of specific Legendaries in single target and AoE situations. Use this as a general guide, but don't treat it as gospel. Remember that different legendaries are propped up by different sets of stats and talents and the charts are simmed with a constant set of gear and talents.
