# TL;DR Recommendations

First things first. All covenants are relatively well balanced. The difference is usually within the single digit percentages and you should pick your covenant depending on what you actually like to play.

Recommending "best" covenant is a pretty impossible tasks.
The strength of the covenants breaks down to the strength of the covenant signature ability, the strength of the covenant class ability and the strength of the soulbinds.
The strength of the soulbind will change every week you gain renown.

So for the TLDR PvE recommendations first

When assuming full renown:

---------|-------------------
Raiding |Necrolord/Night Fae
Mythic+ |Necrolord/Night Fae/Kyrian


If you want to multispec the recommendation changes:

--------------------------|------------------------
Restoration and Elemental | Necrolord
Enhancement and Elemental | Kyrian
All Specs          | Kyrian

We will be discussing the value of specific soulbinds [here]().

# Actual covenants:

![Necrolord_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Death_Lords_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Necrolords__

By pledging your allegiance to the Necrolords you will gain two new abilites:

**{{site.data.spell.fleshcraft}}**

{{site.data.spell.fleshcraft}} is a channeled ability that gives you a 20% HP shield for 2 minutes. This can be amplified to 50% of your HP if it gets cast while in the vicinity of a corpse.

This can be cast before entering combat.
It can be useful as another defensive in our toolkit, but 20% is usually not impactful enough to cast it during combat outside of downtime.

**{{site.data.spell.primordial_wave}}**

{{site.data.spell.primordial_wave}} is an ability on a 45 second cooldown that puts a {{site.data.spell.fs}} onto a target and duplicates the next {{site.data.spell.lvb}} on all targets with an active {{site.data.spell.fs}}.
It accelerates the speed in which we get {{site.spell.data.spell.fs}} out and provides good damage on single target, spread cleave and low target AoE.

It gets affected by the conduit {{site.data.spell.tumbling_waves}} which grants a chance to refresh the cooldown on use.

![Kyrian_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Kyrian_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Kyrian__

By pledging your allegiance to the Kyrian you will gain two new abilites:

**{{site.data.spell.summon_steward}}**

{{site.data.spell.summon_steward}} does what it says on the tin. It summons a  smol, cute, fluffy swolkin, who most importantly, gives you a {{site.data.items.phial_of_serenity}} which can be used to remove Curses, Disease, Poisons and Bleeds. After the changes to the raid, the usefulness of this is vastly more limited. It is still very useful for m+ where a lot of effects can be dispelled even if your group composition doesn't contain the appropriate counter.

**{{site.data.spell.vesper_totem}}**

{{site.data.spell.vesper_totem}} summons a totem that will do AoE damage around itself on the next 3 damage casts you do and heal up to 6 friendlies on the next 3 healing casts.
The totem can also be re-placed by recasting the ability which is not on the GCD.
It is a very nice "set it and forget it" ability which is only slightly dependent on the the tank not moving the targets out of the totem. The ability is mostly limited by targets needing to be stacked up.

{{site.data.spell.elysian_dirge}} is a conduit that increases the damage done by {{site.data.spell.vesper_totem}} to the closest target, increasing it's value in single target.

![NF_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Fae_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Night Fae__

By pledging your allegiance to the Night Fae you will gain two new abilites:

**{{site.data.spell.soulshape}}**

{{site.data.spell.soulshape}} is arguably the strongest of the covenant signature abilities. It turns you into an animal form, teleports you 15 yards forwards and increases your movespeed by 50% for 12 seconds or in rest areas until cancelled. This teleports ports you directly to the ground, meaning it can be used to cancel fall damage. Even though we have a very similar ability in {{site.data.spell.gw}} already, the added teleport enables us to dodge abilities on a short notice.

**{{site.data.spell.fae_transfusion}}**

{{site.data.spell.fae_transfusion}} is a 4 second channeled ability that deals a set amount of damage either to a singular target or split between multiple targets in AoE.
It is Nature damage and can thus be buffed with {{site.data.talent.master_of_the_elements}}. Because of the need to stand still while channeling it, it can sometimes be hard to get the full worth out of the ability, but you can use {{site.data.spell.swg}} to handle that more easily.

{{site.data.spell.essential_extraction}} is a conduit that decreases the cooldown of {{{{site.data.spell.fae_transfusion}}}}

<hr />

![Venthyr_IMG]({{ "assets/img/guide/Venthyr_Sigil.png" | absolute_url}})__Venthyr__

By pledging your allegiance to the Venthyr you will gain two new abilites:

**{{site.data.spell.door_of_shadows}}**

{{site.data.spell.door_of_shadows}} is a short 35 yard teleport with a 1.5 second channel. It can sometimes be used to skip hard packs in mythic+ and skip over gaps that you couldn't get over normally. This is usually not as useful as we are ranged anyway and can reach most targets anyway.

{{site.data.spell.chain_harvest}}

{{site.data.spell.chain_harvest}} is basically a special {{site.data.spell.cl}}. After a 1.5 second channel it deals damage to 5 targets and heals 5 friendlies. Its cooldown gets reduced by 5 seconds for every critical hit, including damage and heal.
{{site.data.spell.lavish_harvest}} increases the critical hit chance of {{site.data.spell.chain_harvest}} by 10%.
