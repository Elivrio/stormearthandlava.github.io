This post collects changes. It does not necessarily analyse them in depths.

## Tier 30

> (2) Set Bonus: Gain Stormkeeper every 40 seconds.
>
> (4) Set Bonus: For 8 seconds after you consume Stormkeeper, your Lightning Bolt, Lava Burst, Icefury, and Frost Shock generate 100% more Maelstrom, and your Chain Lightning, Lava Beam, and Earthquake critical strike damage is increased by 20%.

These bonuses support Lightning focused builds a lot more than Fire ones. Especially in mythic+ the two piece bonus will be noticeable.

## Deeply Rooted Elements

> SHAMAN
> - Deeply Rooted Elements should now activate more consistently for all specializations.

To our current understanding the change results in each {{ site.data.spell.lava_burst }} cast to
have an ever increasing chance to trigger {{ site.data.talent.ascendance }}.
Starting with a double 0% chance then incrementing by 1% per try. This results in a chance chain of
0%, 0%, 1%, 2%, 3%, 4%,...
This averages out to the same known 7% chance and uptime.
It removes the probability of double procs (without {{ site.data.talent.further_beyond }}) and droughts.
