## Special combinations
Ever heard about weapon swapping? It was disabled during Nyalotha's corruption time in Battle for Azeroth.
But now weapons can be swapped once more. Considering that this is an option we can weapon swap between
- [Antumbra, Shadow of the Cosmos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=189852/antumbra-shadow-of-the-cosmos?bonus=6805)
- [Neural Synapse Enhancer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168973/neural-synapse-enhancer?bonus=4777)
- and a normal weapon.

The goal of this swapping is to get the benefit of the active ability followed by swapping to a different weapon during its cooldown.
While [Antumbra, Shadow of the Cosmos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=189852/antumbra-shadow-of-the-cosmos?bonus=6805) is not really an active ability it can be handled as one.
Equip it and you start stacking Versatility slowly. After you reach max stacks and gain double the buff effect a 40 seconds downphase starts.
During this time using a different weapon is quite beneficial. I imagine a typical weapon rotation to be something like this:
1. [Neural Synapse Enhancer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168973/neural-synapse-enhancer?bonus=4777)
1. [Antumbra, Shadow of the Cosmos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=189852/antumbra-shadow-of-the-cosmos?bonus=6805)
1. [Neural Synapse Enhancer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168973/neural-synapse-enhancer?bonus=4777) (again)
1. normal weapon

Starting with the Mechagon weapon to trigger [Gold-Coated Superconductors](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168967/gold-coated-superconductors?bonus=4777) as well.

## Conclusion
Therefore depending on tuning the following slots might become "locked in".

| Slot | Item |
| --- | --- |
| Neck | (Set) [Amulet of the Last Guardian](https://www.wowhead.com/item=142207/amulet-of-the-last-guardian?bonus=1826:1472) |
| Back | (Set) [Wine-Stained Mantle](https://www.wowhead.com/item=142215/wine-stained-mantle?bonus=1826:1472) |
| One-Handed Weapon | [Antumbra, Shadow of the Cosmos](https://www.wowhead.com/item=189852/antumbra-shadow-of-the-cosmos?bonus=6805) |
| Two-Handed Weapon | [Neural Synapse Enhancer](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168973/neural-synapse-enhancer?bonus=4777) |
| Wrist | [Gold-Coated Superconductors](https://www.wowhead.com/item=168967/gold-coated-superconductors?bonus=4777) |
| Finger | [Logic Loop of Recursion](https://www.wowhead.com/item=169158/logic-loop-of-recursion?bonus=4777) (3 different spells) |
| Finger | [Overclocking Bit Band](https://www.wowhead.com/item=169159/overclocking-bit-band?bonus=4777) (haste) |


Or was it a different Ring-combination?

Don't forget, Tier sets and double Legendaries will stay as well. Which means that actually "free" slots will be rare...
